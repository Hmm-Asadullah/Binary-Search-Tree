# Binary Search Tree in C++

## Introduction

This project provides an implementation of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in C++. A Binary Search Tree is a hierarchical data structure that organizes data in a sorted manner, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.

## Features

### Key Characteristics
- The value of every node in the left subtree is less than the value of the root node.
- The value of every node in the right subtree is greater than the value of the root node.
- Ensures efficient operations with an average time complexity of **O(log n)**.

### Supported Operations
1. **Insertion**:
   - Insert a key while maintaining the BST property.
2. **Search**:
   - Locate a key in the tree.
3. **Deletion**:
   - Remove a node while maintaining the BST structure.
   - Handles nodes with 0, 1, or 2 children.
4. **Tree Traversals**:
   - **Inorder Traversal**: Produces a sorted sequence.
   - **Preorder**, **Levelorder** and **Postorder** traversals.
5. **Find Minimum and Maximum**:
   - Find the smallest and largest keys in the tree.
6. **Other Properties**:
   - Compute the height of the tree.
   - Counting Nodes.
   - Computing if the tree is balanced or not.
